## Description:
Plyr2 is a social media platform made by gamers for gamers. Gaming has become one of the top means of social interaction, and this application will help gamers connect with each other based on their mutual interests in game titles and genres. Plyr2 allows for a user to personalize their profile with an avatar, highlight video, handles and usernames across all major consoles, favorite game titles, and preferred genres. Using our algorithm, the application then shows you matches to other users that share similar interests as yourself which will then give you the option to add those users as friends. Lastly, there is a global chat feature which can fix the everlasting issue of looking for gamers to play with at any given second. All users logged in will have the option to participate in the global chat which is used to post when a user is looking to either join a lobby or invite others who are available into their own. 

## Technologies Used:
Plyr2 uses MERN-stack.
>1. __Mongo__- Database used to store all of our data. The application employs Mongoose to manage data relations and create schemas.
>2. __Express__- Allows us to easily build a web server in our backend.
>3. __React__- Handles all of our frontend/client-side.  
>4. __Node__- Allows Javascript code to be run on the backend. 

This application uses __Material-UI__ for the styling. Material-UI has an abundance of components to be used in React applications. Some of the components utilized are Grids for displaying data, Typography to present content clearly and efficiently, and even Snackbars to alert the users for events such as invalid login credentials.   

Next, Plyr2 uses __Passport__ to implement user authentication into the app since we want all users to have their own unique and personalized experience.

Plyr2 also employs an npm known as __YoutubeEmbedVideo__. This helps us easily embed youtube videos onto a react app.

Lastly, Plyr2 makes use of __SocketIO__ which enables realtime communication between web clients and servers. This is how we have implemented a live chat system. 

## Usage: 
First and foremost, you will need to register an account at Plyr2! Once that is done, you may now login with the credentials you have just created. Next, you may update your profile with as much or as little information as you want. Once you hit the "Save" button, you will be taken to the "Matches" page. Here you will be given some of the top users you will have compatibility with based on similar interests. From this page, you may view their profiles and highlights as well as request to be their friend. There is also a global chat feature where you can connect with any ohter Plyr who is online.
